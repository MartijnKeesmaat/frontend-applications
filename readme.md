# ðŸ“¸ Perspective

> Perspective is a project for the [frontend-applications course](https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-19-20/tree/master/frontend-applications) of the [Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hva.nl/)

The goal of the project is to dynamically display data with a front-end framework. My framework of choice is [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).

My concept is based around the early photographers who were able to tell a story through imagery instead of sketching or the written word. I want to educate others by placing them behind the lens. The user can take snapshots of certain important moments in history. These snapshots will be combined with data from the [Tropen Museum](https://www.tropenmuseum.nl/) into an storytelling website.


# At its core
The basic flow revolves around two pages. 
1. A video in which users are challenged to make the perfect snapshot
2. These are then displayed on the result page along with a story

### 1. Snapshots

# Install
The build of choice is webpack with the [svelte loader](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-loader).
- Run `$npm i` to install the node-modules
- Run `$npm run dev` to start the dev environment (opens at localhost:8080)
- Run `$npm rund build` to create a build for deploying



# Wiki
The [wiki](https://github.com/MartijnKeesmaat/frontend-applications/wiki) documents the progress of this project. It goes over the process through the stages of the concept, technical research, visual design and prototype.
